Got it 👍
Here’s a **more personal, first-person README** that sounds like *you* actually designed, coded, tested, and deployed the project — not a generic template.

## 🎯 About the Project

This project was built as part of a **frontend internship assignment**.
The goal was to recreate a **pixel-accurate eCommerce homepage** for a jewelry brand, matching both **desktop and mobile designs**, while keeping the code clean, readable, and responsive.

I focused on translating the design into code as accurately as possible — paying close attention to **spacing, typography, colors, layout, and responsiveness** — and then added subtle JavaScript interactions to enhance the user experience without overdoing it.

* Fully responsive design using **CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries**
